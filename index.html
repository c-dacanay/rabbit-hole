      <h4 class="subhead">#1 / Lurking</h4>      
      <div class="entry test"><p>Between June 2020 and April 2021 I embedded myself in online spaces associated with the alt-right, white supremacy, misogyny and conspiracy theory. In that time I witnessed their reactions to COVID-19, the Black Lives Matter protests, the 2020 Presidential Election, the Storming of Capitol and subsequent right-wing social media crackdown, and International Women’s Day.</p>
      <p>I do not believe in neutral observation. I entered these spaces as I am: a first gen filipina person, a feminist, an artist studying at NYU, a lib bluepilled snowflake, and also a digital native, an ex-anon and an edgelord. I did my best to read things as intended for the community, which most left-leaning journalists fail to do, and that includes identifying trolling and shitposts. </p>
      <p>You can read more about the background to these specific communities, and the introduction of some language, in the <a href="#gloss">glossary</a> section of this project.</p></div>

      <h4 class="subhead" id="dark">#2 / Dark Archetypes</h4>  
      <div class="entry test"><p>Website, incomplete.</p><p>
        A digital guidebook to these internet spaces. The title, and melodramatic tone, is in reference to the way these communities identify themselves: heroes, outlaws, or jesters.</p>
        <p>        The guidebook is currently incomplete, and the pursuit seems rather cringe.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 class="subhead" id="meme">#3 / Meme Gallery</h4>  
    <div class="entry test"><p>Website, incomplete.</p>
<p>A spatialized web gallery of the memes and posts collected from incel, MGTOW and other redpilled communities.

<div class="text middle">   <h2 id="about">About the Project</h2>
  <div class="entry test"><p>Over the past year I’ve set out to demystify certain online ideological tribes, such as incels and Q Anon, to see if deep understanding can help reconcile personal relationships.</p>
<p>Many people who grew up online have always known the power of the internet to shape individuals, and the world. As my peers were playing sports and playing in the neighborhood, I role played on chat rooms, wrote fanfiction, and created deep friendships with people without knowing their real names. Online, disembodied and under a pseudonym, was the first place I felt a sense of belonging. With that belonging grew an understanding of the world that gave me a sense of confidence, and I took those ideas with me to the outside world.  For others, taking their online ideas into the world meant driving to a pizza restaurant with a gun to rescue trafficked children.For me, that meant I was able to identify and socialize with nerds in real life, because I trusted I could bond with them.  For others, taking their online ideas into the world meant driving to a pizza restaurant with a gun to rescue trafficked children. For others, extreme cases, they believed they needed to enact revenge on their classmates for damning you to a life of abject loneliness.</p>
<p>As more people I knew and loved began picking up ideas from fringe internet groups, simplistic analysis did not offer ideas for intervention of conversation. It was high time to take a look at the online communities I feel like I heard about but had never investigated myself. I spent a year doing community observation, interviewing people in politically complicated relationships, and creating interactive experiences to work through questions of discrete communal realities, and to see if I could piece through.</p>
