<div class="entry test"><p class="notes">Interviews, 2021-Ongoing</p><p>Since January I have been conducting interviews with individuals who have relationships with loved ones across ideological differences. While the experience of navigating fraught relationships on and offline is fairly ubiquitous, each relationship has its own unique challenges. I will eventually post my takeaways somewhere?

  <div class="column test">
  <details><summary>Pilled</summary><p>In the 1999 film The Matrix protagonist is offered a choice: “You take the blue pill – the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill – you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.”.</p><p>
    The varieties of online “pills” have boomed in 11 years, far more than what are listed below, but describing someone as “pilled” online usually indicates thorough indoctrination to a prescribed ideology. For example, you might describe a Q Anon follower as having been “Q pilled”.
    </p></details>
  <details><summary>The Blue pill</summary><p>Beliefs associated with the blue pill are that patriarchy dominates Western culture and that women, queer people, and BIPOC are oppressed as a result.</p><p>
    The blue pill is also often associated with normies, “mainstream” people who assimilate into society and are generally offline. Normies and blue pilled folks are typically believed to not think for themselves.
    </p></details>
  <details><summary>The Red pill</summary><p>The red pill was initially backlash against second wave feminism. Thinkers like Rollo Tomassi used evolutionary psychology and critiques of feminism to draw the following conclusions that created the spine of the men’s rights movement:</p><ol><li>Feminism dominates Western culture (gynocentrism)</li><li>Men are oppressed as a result</li><li>Dating is a sexual marketplace</li><li>Women are naturally hypergamous</li></ol><p>These are accepted assumptions among most “red pilled” communities, though organizing principles of the red pill in 2020 include things like traditional conservative values, white supremacy, gun rights and mistrust in mainstream media.</p></details>
  <details><summary>The Black pill</summary><p>The "black pill" generally refers to a set of commonly-held beliefs in incel communities, which include biological determinism, fatalism, and defeatism.</p><p>An incel who has "taken the black pill" has adopted the belief their sexual market value is genetically fixed. As a result their lack of success romantically and sexually is permanent regardless of any changes they might try to make to their physical appearance, personality, or other characteristics. The only thing one can do after taking the blackpill is cope (by trolling or attempting to ascend) or rope (commit suicide). 
  </p></details></div>
  <div class="column test">
    <details><summary>Incels</summary><p>The word incel is short for involuntary celibates, and it was coined by a queer woman in the 90s. Since then, the word has been co-opted by an online subculture whose members define themselves by their inability to attract romantic or sexual partners. Incels are often blackpilled and hopeless. This, paired with rampant misogyny, self-pity and entitlement has produced several mass murderers from the incel community, which is why they are so often reviled. Still, there are incels who genuinely don’t know where else to go to share experiences around male loneliness or insecurity.</p></details>
    <details><summary>MGTOW</summary><p>MGTOW, Men Go Their Own Way, is a community of men organized around freeing themselves from women all together and instead focused on creating their own masculine identities through self-improvement. Many MGTOW men are ex-simps or ex-husbands, having elevated women on the pussy pedestal for a portion of their lives. After negative experiences with dating, betrayal, financial extortion or anything that could build resentment, the MGTOW decide that women are an unnecessary distraction and financial drain, so they find other pursuits. While some of them might engage in meaningless sex with women they generally advise against it.</p></details>
    <details><summary>QAnon</summary><p>In 2017, someone known as “Q” posted on 4chan claiming to be a government official with a Q-level clearance. They claimed to be privy to classified documents within the Trump administration, and a community was built around deciphering Q’s posts in real time.</p><p>
      Like all of these communities, the Q-pilled are not monolithic. QAnon has a uniquely varied membership ranging from the tea party boomers, millennial moms, ex-Bernie Bros, to new age crystal healers. 
      </p></details>
    <details><summary>SJW</summary><p>SJWs, social justice warriors, are individuals who promote socially progressive or libral views with a caricatured frenzy. SJWs are often college snowflakes, BLM protesters, trans activists, and feminist gamers. They are considered by outsiders to be obsessed with personal identity, victimhood, political correctness, and they are man-hating regardless of gender, and intolerant of alternative beliefs by default. They are often accused of virtue signaling and cancel-culture-ing.</p></details></div>
    <div class="column test">
      <details><summary>Anons</summary><p>Anons are anonymous internet posters. Unlike many SJWs, who post on twitter with their real name attached, most incels, MGTOWs, and imageboard posters decide to go anonymous. Occasionally anons on imageboards will claim to be in high ranking government positions who will claim to have access to private information. “CIAAnon” and “FBIAnon” posters were active in the years before QAnon, but they were largely considered to be LARPers.</p></details>
      <details><summary>The Chans</summary><p>Popularized by the Japanese site 2chan, 4chan, 8chan, and 8kun are all variations of imageboards. These boards hosted conversation on a wide variety of topics from anime, politics, video games, porn, and all posting was done anonymously. 4chan, the first English imageboard to gain popularity, is a huge influence on the internet—Rickrolling, lolcats, and Anonymous all originated from the imageboard. 8chan was an organizing hub for abusers during Gamergate after 4chan banned the topic and the origin place of QAnon.</p></details>

  <h2>About the Project</h2>
  <!-- <h4 class="subhead" id="dark">Motivation</h4>   -->
  <div class="entry test">
<p><span class="firstcharacter">M</span>any people who grew up online have always known the power of the internet to shape individuals, and the world. I grew up role playing on chat rooms and created deep friendships with people without knowing their real names. Online, disembodied and under a pseudonym, was the first place I felt a sense of belonging. With that belonging grew an understanding of the world that gave me a sense of confidence, and I took those ideas with me to the outside world. For me, that meant I was able to socialize with nerds in real life, because I trusted I could bond with them. For another, taking online ideas into the world meant driving to a pizza restaurant with a gun to rescue trafficked children. For another still, his toxic ideas from his online reality led them to believe he needed to enact revenge on his classmates for damning him to a life of abject loneliness.
</p>
<p>As more people I knew and loved began picking up ideas from fringe internet groups, simplistic analysis did not offer ideas for intervention of conversation. It was time to take a look at the online communities I heard about but had never investigated myself. I spent a year doing community observation, interviewing people in politically complicated relationships, and creating interactive experiences to work through questions of discrete communal realities to see if I could pierce through.</p>
<p>I do not believe in neutral observation. I entered these spaces as I am: a first gen filipina person, a feminist, an artist studying at NYU, bluepilled PC cuck snowflake, and also a digital native, an ex-anon, and a recovering edgelord. I did my best to read things as intended for the community and that includes identifying trolling and shitposts. 
</p>
<p>By investigating the online communities that have been my ideological opposition I have hoped to find ways of connecting to people who have always been posed as the enemy. I am not a scientist, a journalist, or a therapist, but I do understand the transformative power of communities and relationships that shape our realities. While I don’t agree with, sympathize with or condone most of the beliefs I’ve encountered over the course of this project, my picture of the world has been expanded by confronting these groups and trying to understand them in their own words. That picture is not simple or comforting, but it is honest in its complexity, and complexity is something hard to hold in an age of filter bubbles. 
</p>
<p>This thesis is part of my ongoing research in the areas of interactive storytelling, underground subcultures, stupid memes, and etymological oddities.</p>
